I'm a 34 year old dad of 3.

Just starting my coding journey.  I can do it. I know how to. I've started from zero many times to reach difficult personal goals.

    1. When I started learning Japanese (now have working proficiency)

    2. When I started in IT (now Technical Support Team lead)

    3. Now, learning Web Development I can apply every hard lesson I have learned to becoming a solid developer.
