I'm a 34 year old dad of 3.

I've started from zero many times to reach difficult personal goals, for example;

    1. When I started learning Japanese (now have working proficiency),

    2. When I started in IT (now Technical Support Team lead),
    
    3. When I was a tour guide for Japanese travellers to Australia,
    
    3. When I had kids (now I have 3! U+1F605 )


I've thrived on learning.  It has defined me.  I've been in that place where you think the goal is unsurmountable, and I have reached it. I know how to learn new things. I can't slow down or stop for fear of missing out. 

Programming and software development gives me everything I need professionally to continue.  There is a massive learning curve but progress is clear and noticable. I have spent so long looking at the beautiful designs and apps throughout the web and now I can join in the creation.
