.. where  to start?  I'll just start writing..

## 2010 - SmartPhones

I got a smartphone and they had apps.  I knew Japanese and I had taught English.  I know a great idea for an app!  It's what I wished I had when I was learning Japanese! .. Oh shit, I don't know how to code.. or where to start.  And I am still mastering this Japanese Tour Guide thing.. I've heard of Eclipse... Hmm, not yet.

## 2012 - Service Desk job for the tour company I worked for

I'll move  to Melbourne (from Uluru...) and finally get to learn about PCs and then decide which direction I'd like to go in ICT (still called IT at this point..)

## 2012 - 2016 - z-index, padding and margins starting to feel like the same thing.. :confused:overwhelmed:
Dabbled in some online HTML, CSS courses, got confused and frustrated with the lack of time & commitment needed to remember things I learned... gave up.

## 2016 - a taste of buidling something fundamentally useful

At the company I worked for, the entire 4 years leading up to this point whenever we needed to put an Operating System image a PC or Laptop, we had to manually:

- Plug in a USB and boot to it
- Add the PC to the domain
- Customize the UI and install all programs
- Install Windows updates over 2 or 3 days

I had heard about ways to create an image with all of the above pre-configured and deploy it over the network, but I was so busy resetting passwords, changing toners and doing desk moves (specialist programs didn't roam well) that I never had time to research it, let alone implement it.

So, 2016 ticked over and I set myself a goal of automating the deployment of our Windows 7 images to PCs at any means possible.

Time never came my way at work, so I started waking up at 5 am every day (with a 3 year old and a newborn) to research, plan and configure the images.

3 months later I had Windows 7 Professional tested, debugged and deploying perfectly to the 15+ models of desktop PC we had at our offices and remote sites.  By July I had included laptops and also Windows 8.1 to our mobile fleet.

** Now, when we needed a new image, it took 40 minutes to automate all of the above steps **

The time this saved colleagues and I ~~was quickly snuffled up with other work by my manager~~ was huge!  The feeling I got from being able to automate a manual task and save everyone so much time was incredible. I enjoyed the feeling so much, I continued to use this skill with all our software catalogue, new versions of windows over different models of machines in different offices in the world - all still at 5am in the morning before work.
