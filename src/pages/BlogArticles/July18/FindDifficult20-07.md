title: "Q: My biggest struggle with frontend development over the last month?"
---

#A: 
Discovering a project, a task - *something* - that makes me crazy about it. For example, when I learned scripting last year I wrote a few scripts that wiped out so many manual tasks at work. It was instantaneously beneficial and overwhelmingly satisfying. 

I dreamed about it, I was constantly thinking about the issues I had when I walked to work.  This feeling is multiplied when I can help save the time of other people. I haven’t got to this level of obsession with web development. 

I’ve been learning every night and lunch breaks for 4 months, reading about it in my spare time and taking regular days off to practice. I think it’s because PowerShell is one language, I only needed to learn a bit to be dangerous. But there are so many web development things to learn; HTML, CSS, JS, GIT, REACT etc, deployment, CS fundamentals, testing. 

I feel myself building up my skills, but I don’t have the ideas or enough skill to build something I believe to be truly useful yet, like: 
    - A laptop/equipment loan register
    - A web UI for my scripts - but Web and PowerShell?? I don’t have any idea if it’s possible or I can substitute PowerShell for Node or pythod or C#... see my point?  I get too overwhelmed.
