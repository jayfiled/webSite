**July**
- &#128293; Completed the Responsive Web Design Challenges on <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a> and also the <a href="https://codepen.io/jayfiled/full/YjPmEX">Survey form</a> project. (To go with the  <a href="https://codepen.io/jayfiled/full/OZqNOy">portfolio</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/jayfiled/full/ZowvbG">tribute</a> projects. ) &#128293;
- Wrote a new feature into my PowerShell Windows Forms program - gets the list of installed programs from a remote PC and sorts them by installed date and presents it to you as a text file.  Surprised myself how easy writing it was - learning JS has helped.
- Advised manager that I would like to pursue a career in development
- Took a day off and completed a bunch of JS challenges - struggled with nested loops, but nutted it out now &#128170;&#127996;
- <a href="https://codepen.io/jayfiled/full/QBEeKo">Designed the cards for the index page of my tutorials</a>

**June**
- Found a use for Twitter!
- Followed a <a href="https://emkaydeum.wordpress.com/2017/01/01/css-html-holiday-trees/">tutorial which improved my Github skills and first experience in open source collaboration</a>.
- Started FreeCodeCamp, <a href="https://codepen.io/jayfiled/full/ZowvbG">build my first site</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/jayfiled/full/OZqNOy/">second site</a>.
- Stumbled upon a Gatsby walkthrough on Medium/FreeCodeCamp, made it, ruined it, did it again, toyed with deploying in GitHub, eventually deployed on Netlify
- Tweaked, remixed, hacked away at the Gatsby site to build it into a platform for:
    - A place to talk out loud to myself
    - A place to show what I've built
    - A place for me to explain the things I have learned, to me =) "A place to Feynman things"
- Started to feel like a developer!

**May**
- Friend recommended me to his place of work and I had a phone interview and an in-person interview as a code tester / junior developer but didn't get the job
- Finished Codecademy Course
- Created a Dice game through Udemy JS course - published on GitHub pages
- Sought advice about pathways into development at current employment & decided to build a reasonable portfolio before making a move.

- Friend had changed jobs, progressed through being a full stack developer to a development tech lead and 'specializing in Node.js'
- Started Web Development languages and put PowerShell to the side for the meantime.

**2017**
- Committed to C# as I worked with Windows for so long - not sure what terms like C# or 'full-stack' meant yet

- Confused on how to start.
- Started writing one liners in PowerShell to acheive things like;
    - Remotely restarting services
    - Removing appx packages from Windows 8
- Good Friend/Co-worker turned into Full-Stack developer from taking over from a developer that left, and went from zero to full-time developer.

**2015** 
- Dabbled with HTML intranet site at work.
- Good friend and co-worker left to help manage friend's Website

**2013**
