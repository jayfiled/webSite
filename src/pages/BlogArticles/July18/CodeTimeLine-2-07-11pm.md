title: "My coding timeline"
---

**2011**
- Loved Smartphone apps - had ideas to make one - installed Eclipse on macbook - watched Madmen instead.

**2013**
- Codecademy HTML & CSS - nothing sunk in, not inspired enough to make time to practice.

**2015** 
- Dabbled with HTML intranet site at work.
- Good friend and co-worker left to help manage friend's Website

**2016** 
- Installed Android Studio with intentions of following guides to make simple apps, realised I didn't have time for it at that time in my life - gave up.
- Confused on how to start.
- Started writing one liners in PowerShell to acheive things like;
    - Remotely restarting services
    - Removing appx packages from Windows 8
- Good Friend/Co-worker turned into Full-Stack developer from taking over from a developer that left, and went from zero to full-time developer.

**2017**
- Committed to C# as I worked with Windows for so long - not sure what terms like C# or 'full-stack' meant yet
- Started C# on the SoloLearn app - progressed 20% in about 2 months, explanations and words started to make no sense
- Purchased Udemy course 'Learn C#' by Mosh Hamadani
- Began 'Powershell for beginners' course on Micrsoft Virtual Academy
- Started writing scripts in PowerShell
- Wrote my first program using powershell and referencing .NET assemblies to build a Windows Forms program
- Purchased Udemy powershell course

**2018**
- Friend had changed jobs, progressed through being a full stack developer to a development tech lead and 'specializing in Node.js'
- Started Web Development languages and put PowerShell to the side for the meantime.
    
    **March**
    
- Started JavaScript on SoloLearn
- Created my first JavaScript project - a new tab chrome extension following CodeCademy's guide
###Game changing moment - I discovered MEDIUM
> .. through some articles that appeared in my Google feed!
- Dabbled in a node walkthrough
- Learned Git on Codecademy
- Started JavaScript Codecademy
- Purchased Udemy Course 'Learn JavaScript by building real world projects' by Jonas Schmedtmann

    **April**
- Finished Sololearn JavaScript, started HTML
- Used a lot of annual leave to work on the Udemy JS course
- Purchased Udemy Course 'React and React Router' by Maximillian Schwartzmeuller
- Started coding during lunch breaks

    **May**
- Friend recommended me to his place of work and I had a phone interview and an in-person interview as a code tester / junior developer but didn't get the job
- Finished Codecademy Course
- Created a Dice game through Udemy JS course - published on GitHub pages
- Sought advice about pathways into development at current employment & decided to build a reasonable portfolio before making a move.

    **June**
- Found a use for Twitter!
- Followed a <a href="https://emkaydeum.wordpress.com/2017/01/01/css-html-holiday-trees/">tutorial which improved my Github skills and first experience in open source collaboration</a>.
- Started FreeCodeCamp, <a href="https://codepen.io/jayfiled/full/ZowvbG">build my first site</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/jayfiled/full/OZqNOy/">second site</a>.
- Stumbled upon a Gatsby walkthrough on Medium/FreeCodeCamp, made it, ruined it, did it again, toyed with deploying in GitHub, eventually deployed on Netlify
- Tweaked, remixed, hacked away at the Gatsby site to build it into a platform for:
    - A place to talk out loud to myself
    - A place to show what I've built
    - A place for me to explain the things I have learned, to me =) "A place to Feynman things"
- Started to feel like a developer!
