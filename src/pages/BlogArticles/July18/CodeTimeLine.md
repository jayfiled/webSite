**2011**
- Loved Smartphone apps - had ideas to make one - installed Eclipse on macbook - watched Madmen instead.

**2013**
- Codecademy HTML & CSS - nothing sunk in, not inspired enough to make time to practice.

**2015** 
- Dabbled with HTML intranet site at work.

**2016** 
- Installed Android Studio with intentions of following guides to make simple apps, realised I didn't have time for it at that time in my life - gave up.
- Confused on how to start.
- Started writing one liners in PowerShell to acheive things like;
    - Remotely restarting services
    - Removing appx packages from Windows 8

**2017**
