I'll have to admit, I didn't know how to translate people's advice of 'you should learn x'.  'x' may look a little bit like this:

`x = [javaScript, reactJS, gitHub, jQuery, AngularJS, bootstrap]`

So I started with Javascript.  I did the codecademy course and spent at least 15 hours on an Udemy course, and, while they are great and I got a LOT out of it and enjoyed it, I felt a slight niggle the whole time thatm made me think I should be stopping and practicing each topic as I learned it, but neither platform had the (free) means to do so.

I continued on until I bumped into Zell Liew's awesome 'Build a CRUD app in Node and express' walkthrough.  His teaching style was super straight forward but not lengthy, so I checked out his site.

Unsurprisingly, he had his own course on JavaScript and heavily marketed it.  The intake hadn't started at that point yet, but he had an 'email based JavaScript course' that you could sign up to, so I did.

His approach really targeted people like me who jumped straight in and took everyone's advice and learned 'all the things' at once, started steps too far ahead, rushed through fundamentals so that we can get to the 'build cool stuff' phase.

He had been there.  And had gotten through it, evaluated his own learnings and systematically developed a system that is a fail safe way of learning JavaScript.
