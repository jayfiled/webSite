title: "When in doubt, blog"
---

I've been having doubts about whether I can become a professional front-end developer.  Since starting 5 months ago, I have learned things that I thought were beyond me.  

I code at lunch, I code for hours every night.  I've done the #100DaysofCode challenge (and I'm into round 2), I take days off work to grind out fundamentals in JS.  Every spare moment I have I am learning the next thing and improving on learned coding topics... I've even enlisted some help from a developer at my work to help me get our companies replica website set up on my laptop so I can start making pull requests to our company's website.

.. but I still feel like I know nothing.  Like I am at least a coding bootcamp or a software diploma away from getting a junior web dev job..

The last two weeks, I've spent every night:

     - Attempting to add prism.js to my gatsby site so my code snippets have a color theme.
     - Working through setting up my work's sitecore websites, databases and configuring IIS on my laptop.

But despite learning a bunch along the way, I haven't completely finished either of these 'tasks'.

I don't want to take up too much time of the developer that is helping me, so when I run into issues, I spend hours going over the instructions step by step, reverting, running into errors, researching online, backtracking and trying new things.  I've worked through a lot of issues myself, but I feel terrible about going back to him to say I'm stuck.  I don't know whether it is my lack of experience and knowledge that is causing it to take so long to get a replica of a website up and running, or wether setting up a replica website on your own laptop is ACTUCALLY a very fiddly, finicky process.  I'm afraid of the truth if I ask.   

Other things that cause doubt:
- Most videos about going from knowing no code, to becoming a developer seem to be people who were engineers, super keen maths-wizards or had a css degree.

None of this relates to me.  I like Maths, but it wasn't something I've exercised.  I like problem solving, but rely on hard work and enthusism to get to the solution.  I don't have a great memory, but, daily, I am training it. I don't pick up difficult subjects quickly, *but*, since learning to code, I have started to ask better questions.
But I *am* passionate about web development/scripting and computers. I'll spend 4 hours getting my head around it when I get home.

- I look at the requirements in job postings for a junior front end developer and realise that I am at least a year away of self study and a diploma / bootcamp away from even being considered at interviews.

## What I realised by writing all of this

The doubts I have can all be solved.  The only thing in between now (not knowing) and knowing something is..  time.  Just gotta enjoy the ride and not get so frustrated.
