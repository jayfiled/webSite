 *just a brain dump - polish later*

I'm having doubts about whether I can become a professional front-end developer. (the most realistic opportunity for me to start being a dev)

Objective: become a junior front end developer.

```javaScript
function addPrismJS(text) {
    console.log(text);
}

addPrismJS('I wonder if this works?');
```

Caveat: don't sacrifice my relationship with my wife, or miss any of my children's childhood to acheive the above.

- Most videos about becoming a developer are people who were engineers, interested in maths or had a css degree

- I am none of those.  Just a hard worker with a lot of enthusism.  I don't have a great memory, I don't pick up difficult subjects quickly, I don't enjoy sudoku, or have spent time solving logical puzzles for fun.

- Even though I put in 3 - 4 hours a night, I don't feel like I'm getting close to the goal.

- I look at the requirements in job postings for a junior front end developer and realise that I am at least a year away of self study and a diploma / bootcamp away from even being considered at interviews.

The good news is that the doubts I have can all be solved.  I realise that TIME can erase the doubt.  I am enjoying the ride, but I need to accept that I will acheive my goal, but it will take time.
