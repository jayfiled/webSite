**December**
- Extremely busy with after hours work, but managed to squeeze in a bunch of JS problems on [project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/sign_in), [CoderByte](https://coderbyte.com/) and freeCodeCamp.org's [basic JavaScript algorithms](https://github.com/jayfiled/fcc) üí¶
- Went on a work trip to the UK and built my first [React app](https://jayfiled.github.io/fancyCats/) to practice the fundamentals. üî•

**November**
- Completed many projects and exercises in the Zero to Mastery course from CSS to REACT.  Listed in the readme.md [here](https://github.com/jayfiled/ZeroToMasteryProjects)
   


**October**
- Realised my JavaScript skills were outpacing my HTML and CSS skills, so started a course to address the gap called [Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery)
- Got some great DOM manipulation practice in and üéå [finished my Japanese app for my kids](https://jayfiled.github.io/HiraganaFlash/)üé¥
- [Felt down about no coding progress over the last few weeks.](/timepoor) But should be able to start stringing more time together this month

**September**
- Started looking into WordPress & WooCommerce for a friend who asked me to do up a website with e-commerce.
- Focussed on really *understanding* JS, instead of getting ahead of myself.
- [Added all my notes from the JS fundamentals course I did to a website](https://jayfiled.github.io/JScheat/) so I can use it as a quick reference and exercise review.
- Finished [JS fundamentals with Mosh](https://www.udemy.com/javascript-basics-for-beginners). (I really wish this course just kept going.. )
- Started [hack reactor's](https://prep.hackreactor.com/p/hack-reactor-prep) (the only bootcamp I could find that uses full stack JavaScript) bootcamp prep, which pointed me down the prerequisite path of:
- [Udacity's JS course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803)
- [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/) üê±‚Äçüíª (their callback function and async explanation gave me a lightbulb moment)
- üìö [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (I really do prefer reading physical books)
- üíª [Watch and Code with Gordon Zhu](https://watchandcode.com) (gives a very good example of breaking a requirement into chunks, starting with an MVP and building from there - really, really enjoying this üëç)

**August**
- Worked on freeCodeCamp projects on lunch breaks - <a href="https://github.com/jayfiled/product-landing-page">Project landing page</a> 
- Talked to the head of digital about a possible move into web development and he was accommodating - allocating a developer to help me set up our sitecore instance on my laptop üòÇ
- Spend most evenings following instructions of the dev to set up sitecore; Visual Studio, Version control, NPM, IIS, SQL server, bindings - a whole new world of overwhelm üò£
- Worked slowly through JS Control flow, Object and Array fundamentals with heaps of exercises <a href="https://github.com/jayfiled/JSBasics/blob/master/index.js">(2500 lines of JavaScript and comments)</a>
- Played around in serverless by writing two Alexa skills - one that suggests a place to eat for lunch around work, one that recommends a tour to you.
- Dabbled in APIs with openweathermap.org and made a <a href="https://github.com/jayfiled/simple-weather-app">simple command line app</a> that gets the temp &#x1F305 in a city of your choice.

**July**
- &#128293; Completed the Responsive Web Design Challenges on <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a> and also the <a href="https://github.com/jayfiled/survey-form">Survey form</a> project. (To go with the  <a href="https://github.com/jayfiled/portfolio">portfolio</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/jayfiled/full/ZowvbG">tribute</a> projects. ) &#128293;
- Wrote a new feature into my PowerShell Windows Forms program - gets the list of installed programs from a remote PC and sorts them by installed date and presents it to you as a text file.  Surprised myself how easy writing it was - learning JS has helped.
- Advised manager that I would like to pursue a career in development
- Took a day off and completed a bunch of JS challenges - struggled with nested loops, but nutted it out now &#128170;
- <a href="https://codepen.io/jayfiled/full/QBEeKo">Designed the cards for the index page of my tutorials</a>

**June**

- Started FreeCodeCamp, <a href="https://codepen.io/jayfiled/full/ZowvbG">build my first site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jayfiled/portfolio">second site</a>.
- Stumbled upon a Gatsby walk through on Medium/FreeCodeCamp, made it, ruined it, did it again, toyed with deploying in GitHub, eventually deployed on Netlify
- Tweaked, remixed, hacked away at the Gatsby site to build it into a platform for:
    - A place to talk out loud to myself
    - A place to show what I've built
    - A place for me to explain the things I have learned, to me =) "A place to Feynman things"
