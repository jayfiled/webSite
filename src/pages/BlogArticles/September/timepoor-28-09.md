###The daily ~~grind~~ squeeze

Ok, so I've been struggling to get much coding in during September. Don't get me wrong - I've taken some important and necessary steps for my career.  But it has all been at the expense of time coding.

On a good week, if everything goes perfectly, I have 19 hours to practice coding.  I've found my passion at a unique time in my life, so I am forced to play the long game to reach my goals.

My wife and I are raising 3 kids without family assistance, so I don't sacrifice my time with her or the kids to code. It happens on my (short) lunch breaks, evenings from 9pm to 11pm and a 3.5 hour block on Sunday afternoon (thanks wife ðŸ’‘).

I get that time to code as long as there are no obligatory social events, my wife doesn't get any time to herself, kids go to sleep (and stay asleep) on time, no one gets sick and wifey goes grocery shopping (from 9pm to 11pm).

Preferably I'd like to spend all day and night coding.  I've got the enthusiasm, concentration and passion to do so.  But I have to concentrate the learning into these few hours.  The best outcome would be to get a junior position, code and learn all day, practice and refactor at night.  I came to the conclusion that the easiest route to this goal would be through my current employer - so I stated asking questions to see how much of a possibility that would be. 

A dev manager at my work suggested I get a diploma in software, or web development.  Then at some time later into the course, he believes he could accommodate me in his team at some point.

So, I spent a good portion of that limited time looking into Web and Software development Diplomas. It took some time to decide which was a better fit, the differences between courses at different institutions and what stacks they use etc.

Following the advice from the dev manager, I contacted a local institute and they suggested a traineeship with one day at the school, and the rest learning from the developers at work.  The problem was that my employer won't accommodate any more than one day to shadow a dev (and I'd have to make up for that day by working more on the other days, while doing the diploma remotely).

So, I [mapped out my week to see what exactly it would look like in that scenario](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hc-ULqXYLXON-Y2ZpJzshMlOJ3tOVSWaDxzssHmUku4/edit#gid=1271188884), and came to the realisation that I wouldn't have time to do the assessments.  I'd have to rely on my week running perfectly (for the duration of the diploma), cram 5 working days into 4, use all of my allocated coding hours to reading diploma materials.  Not to mention that there is a mandatory 1 day on campus for assessments.  I'd have to give up the 1 with a dev at my work to go into campus. It wouldn't work - the stress I'd put my family and myself under wouldn't be sustainable. Not the ideal learning environment.

I'll propose that I keep self-learning, focussing on skills and knowledge addressed in the core and elective units from the diploma courses. I'd then spend Friday afternoon shadowing some front-end devs and in my personal coding time I'll work on the myriad bugs, documentation and low-level things they holding them back from providing real business value. They sacrifice 4 hours on Friday to me, I do the work they don't have time for. Win, win right?

**Even IF I get to spend time with the developers at my work:**

Angular is used on the front end in most projects.ðŸ˜° I know that one must have a pretty solid grasp AND working experience with JavaScript to be able to pick up a framework or library and really utilize and understand it.  This is a big reason for my [double-back to the basics throughout September](/timelineCode).  Whereas I feel like I'm going down the best track for understanding of JS, I still haven't made my first commit to our production websites and don't look to be doing so any time soon, because..

**3 kids 5 and under, 3 strains of virus back to back** makes for some very unsettled and sleep deprived kids.  That time I dedicate to coding from 9 - 11?  It got wiped out, or severely interrupted since the start of September. I write this, at 11:30pm, settling my fever-maddened son with one hand while I type this on the other).  It's been going on for a month and a half, and my eldest has a house-awakening cough the whole time (asthma... ?).

Anyway, I don't begrudge the kids (they are the reason I have so much energy and enthusiasm). But it is a little unsettling to not feel like I am progressing in a steady fashion. I've been squeezing in as much coding and career focussed  efforts into the gaps as possible as that's all I've got.  I'm playing the long game.  It will come, I *do* feel the progress, just gotta remember to enjoy all the moments, not just those spent coding.

I've got some annual leave coming up, where we will fly to see our respective parents ("Hi mum/stepmum, can you look after these kids while I spend the next 72 hours coding?")
