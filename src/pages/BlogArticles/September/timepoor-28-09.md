Ok, so I've been struggling to get much coding in during September. Don't get me wrong - I've taken some important and necessary steps for my career.  But it has all been at the expense of time coding.

On a good week, if everything goes perfectly, I have 19 hours to practice coding.  My wife and I are raising 3 kids without family assistance, so I don't sacrifice my time with her or the kids to code. It happens on my (time limited) lunch breaks, evenings from 9pm to 11pm and a 3.5 hour block on Sunday afternoon (thanks wife ðŸ’‘).

I get that time to code as long as there are no obligitory social events, my wife doesn't get any time to herself, kids go to sleep (and stay asleep) on time, wife goes grocery shopping (from 9pm to 11pm) and no one gets sick.

A dev manager at my work suggested I get a diploma in software, or web development.  Then at some time later into the course, he beleives he could accomodate me in his team at some point.

So, I spent a good portion of that limited time looking into Web or Software Developent related Diploma options; decding which was a better fit, the differences between courses at different institutions, what stacks they use etc.

Following the advice, I contacted a local institute and they suggested a traineeship with one day at the school, and the rest learning from the developers at work.  The problem was that my work won't allow me to dedicate any more than one day to it (and I'd have to make up for that day by working more on the other days).

I [mapped out my week to see what that would look like](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hc-ULqXYLXON-Y2ZpJzshMlOJ3tOVSWaDxzssHmUku4/edit#gid=1271188884), and came to the realisation that I wouldn't have time to do the assessments.  I'd have to rely on my week running perfectly (for the duration of the diploma), and even then my potential study/coding hours dropped to 15 for the whole week. It wouldn't work, and I'd be creating a whole lot of extra stress for my wife.  Not the ideal learning environment.

I'll propose that I keep self-learning, focussing on skils and knowledge addresses in the core and elective units from the diploma courses. I'd then spend Friday afternoon shadowing some front-end devs and make up the extra time after hours.

On the topic of the front end interfaces at my work.. they use Angular.  Of course it's a framework.  I know that one must have a pretty solid grasp AND working experience with JavaScript to be able to pick up a framework and really utilize and understand it.  This is a big reason for my [double-back to the basics throughout September](/timelineCode).  Whereas I feel like I on the right track, I still haven't made my first commit to our production websites and don't look to be doing so any time soon, because..

**3 kids 5 and under, 3 strains of virus back to back** makes for some very unsettled and sleep deprived kids.  That time I had from 9 - 11?  Wiped out, or severly interupted - I write, at 11:30pm, settling my fever-maddened son with one hand while I type this).  It's been going on for a month and a half, and the eldest has a house-awakening cough the whole time (asthma... ?).

Anyway, I've been slotting as much coding and career nudging efforts into the gaps as possible as that's all I've got.  I'm playing the long game.  It will come, I feel the progress, just gotta remember to enjoy all the moments, not just those spent coding.

I've got some annual leave coming up, where we will fly to see our respective parents ("Hi mum/stepmum, can you look after these kids while I spend the next 72 hours coding?")
