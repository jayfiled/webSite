title: "Implemented cards for tutorials"
---
<p class="pmd">I wanted to make some 'cards' to use on my website for things like when I explain code, make index pages for tutorials etc so, I made some nice ones in codepen:</p>

> <a href="https://codepen.io/jayfiled/full/RJMLeV">.. cards on codepen</a>

I then realised that I would be using them a lot on my site, and this might be a good oportunity to create something basic with reactJS, so I followed the feature packed, 15 minute *Writing our first react code* segment in Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's - so far, <strong>great</strong> -  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/">Udemy course</a> and I was able to make my card a component and render it to the DOM.

The problem was, my site is created by GatsbyJS and doesn't have a html file to render to.  All the page files are .JS

Luckily all I had to do was watch the segment about <strong>understanding components</strong> and <strong>outputting dynamic content</strong> to really wrap my head around it and know that all I need to do is export the function and use it in another function on another page like a HTML element.. thanks Max

I did spend a good hour trying to figure out how to change the line spacing on the Blog landing page.  All the snippets are generated by a graphQL query but I think I need nut out how that works a bit better first... or sleep on it because I couldn't find out how to change it.. ALSO the spacing of the markdow I couldn't change.

Things to do: &#128373;

- ~~Figure out the line spacing and how the CSS is cascading so I can tweak it~~

    - All the .css files from src/styles were being imported and the last one (tutorials.css) was overriding the others... find out how to specify which ones to import (create a new folder for specific css files?)
- ~~Find out why the background text on my cards has a white background.~~
    - Just had  to remove the background, re-add and restart the dev server... &#128531;
- Find out how put more dynamic content in react components -  muliple lines of text look weird in the JSX element
- Whizz up some static cards for the front page of the tutorial area
- Find out how to move the sidebar to the right a bit more
- Add a nav bar to the tutorial page that has links to the languages covered in the tutorial which you can hover over in order to navigate to it
