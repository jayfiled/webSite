## 2010 - 2016

I'd been keen on coding and development since the first smartphones came out.  I dabbled in online courses. Couldn't get motivated, didn't yet know how to approach it.

## 2016 - a taste of buidling something fundamentally useful

**History** &#128218;

At the company I worked at, for the entire 4 years leading up to this point whenever we needed to put an Operating System image (Windows 7, 8 10 etc) a PC or Laptop, we had to manually:

- Plug in a USB and boot to it, format, partition HDD, click through setup options
- Add the PC to the domain
- Customize the UI and install all programs
- Install Windows updates 

.. which took over 2 or 3 days - for each machine ðŸ™„

I had heard about ways to create an image with all of the above pre-configured and deploy it over the network, but I was so busy resetting passwords, changing toners and moving PCs from desk to desk that I never had time to research it, let alone implement it during business hours.

**Action** 	&#128293;

So, 2016 ticked over and I set myself a goal of completely removing that task from my (and my colleagues) job.

Time never came my way at work, so instead of writing off the goal and continuing like every other year, I started waking up at 5 am every day (with a 3 year old and a newborn) to research, plan and configure the images.

After a lot of trial and error, 3 months later I had replicated our company's desktop Operating system. I had created, tested, broke, debugged and finally deployed it perfectly to the 15+ models of desktop PC (all needing their own set of drivers).  By July I had gone through the same process for laptop images and also a new Windows 8.1 image for our Microsoft Surfaces.

**Now, when we needed to put a new operating system image onto a PC, we could do it in a few clicks and the time it took was cut from 2 -  3 days down to 45 minutes**

The time this saved colleagues and I ~~was quickly snuffled up with other work by my manager~~ was huge!  The feeling I got from being able to automate a manual task and save everyone so much time was incredible. I enjoyed the feeling so much, I continued to use this skill with all our software catalogue, new versions of windows over different models of machines in different offices in the world

.. all at 5am in the morning.
