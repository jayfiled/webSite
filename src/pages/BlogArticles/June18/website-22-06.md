<!-- Put each section in an accordion -->
I've just whipped up this site using a walkthrough.. it's just a blog site, but I need to change it into my platform.

It needs:
* A landing page &#10003; - which includes: <!-- a check mark -->
    * Go to my blog link &#10003; 
    * Go to my portfolio link &#10003; 
    * Go to my tutorials sections &#10003;


<!-- Insert GIF for my ServiceDesk app & link to GitHub repo -->
I think I need to use webPack or another graphQL query to insert the GIF I created that showcases my app - explained
