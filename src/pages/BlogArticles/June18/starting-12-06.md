&#128304; I'm a 34 year old dad of 3.

I've started from zero many times to reach difficult personal goals, for example;

    1. When I started learning Japanese (now have working proficiency),

    2. When I started in IT (now Technical Support Team lead),
    
    3. When I was a Japanese speaking tour guide,
    
    3. When I had kids (now I have 3!)


I've thrived on learning.  It has defined me.  I've been in that place where you think the goal is too far away, too hard. I've fought through the doubt and I have reached it - many times. I know how to learn new things. I can't slow down or stop for fear of losing myself.

Programming and software development gives me everything I need professionally to continue.  There is a massive learning curve, and sometimes the goals seem too far away, but progress is clear and noticable. I have spent so long looking at the beautiful designs and apps throughout the web and now I can join in the creation.
