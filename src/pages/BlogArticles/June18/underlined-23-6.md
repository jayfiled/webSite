title: "Blue underlined links"

I was browsing the Wired.com website on my mobile and was impressed by it's complicated simplicity.  It had a plain white background and simple typography, but as you read, little things that impressed me were:

- The blue, *highlighted* style of hyperlink
- The timing of the header shrinking to give the article more screen space
- The way the header turns to social media links towards the bottom of the article

So, as you would already know, I incorporated them into my site:

I couldn't choose between this style:
<img class="blog-img" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_u22MQMHLfOBeuHynIpeGnvtt-iV8FNg">

Or this:
<img class="blog-img" src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Hj9ZoYkyOGs_skP5KMbuPBXKk5GyshfS">

But in the end, I thought I enjoyed the simplicity of the thinner line better :-)

I've detailed how to replicate and remix them in <a href="#">this tutorial  </a><sup>coming soon..</sup>
